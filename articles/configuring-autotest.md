I have a big test suite in the current Rails application I'm working on. I have 2340 examples in
RSpec, taking over 2 minutes to run. This is an absolute pain to run. Luckily there is autotest (or
autospec if you're running RSpec, like I am), which tests only the changed files. I've grown to be
totally dependent on this behavior, and I can't imagine programming without it anymore.

I also do TDD, which means that I write a failing test first, and then program until it passes. But
Autotest's flow is that, once you've fixed a failing test or spec, it reruns the entire the suite to
see if you're solution doesn't have any side effects. Normally this is fine, but with this kind of
test suite, I cannot afford to wait for it to complete.

So, after going through Autotest's code, I've decided to stub out this behavior. You can still
trigger a complete rerun of the entire suite by pressing Ctrl+C, but it doesn't do that every time
you go green. It's a bit of a monkey patch, but it works just right.

The autotest-growl gem clears the terminal. I don't like that, because I like to see a bit of
history. That's why I changed that behavior too.

Here's my `~/.autotest` file:

``` ruby
# Use file system hooks on OS X
require 'autotest/fsevent'

# Don't run entire test suite when going from red to green
class Autotest
  def tainted
    false
  end
end

# Use Growl support
require 'autotest/growl'

# Don't clear the terminal, when using Growl
module Autotest::Growl
  @@clear_terminal = false
end
```

While browsing through the code of Autotest I also found that it also looks for a `.autotest` file
in the current working directory. So if you want to apply these changes to one project only, you can
define this file locally for the project. I didn't know that!
