There is a real annoying gotcha in using controller tests to test an action that renders a pdf with
[Prawn](http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/). You'll get a NoMethodException on "nil.downcase".
The troubling part is that it totally puts you off by providing the wrong lines and backtrace.

This has been mentioned somewhere on some
[mailinglists](http://groups.google.com/group/prawn-ruby/browse_thread/thread/a44c7647894d165c), but
to make it a bit more findable, I'd thought I'd post it here.

The <del>solution</del> workaround is to set the server protocol, like this:

``` ruby
it "should show the pdf" do
  request.env["SERVER_PROTOCOL"] = "http"
  get :show, :id => "report", "format" => "pdf"
  response.should render_template(:show)
end
```
