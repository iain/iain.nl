**I made this into a plugin: [translatable_columns](/plugin-translatable_columns).**

Dmitry [asked in the comments](/translating-activerecord#comment-96) of my last post [about translating ActiveRecord](/translating-activerecord):

> Can you write about how to use translated columns of database in rails? For example we have table
named ‘blog’, and I want to translate it on several languages: fr, en, ru. How to do that?

And although I don't think this is the way to go, I can of course demonstrate an easy way to do
this, using I18n.

Here's the table definition:

``` ruby
create_table :posts do |t|
  t.string :title_en, :title_nl, :title_fr, :title_de
  t.string :text_en, :text_nl, :text_fr, :text_de
end
```

So what you'd want to do is read the currently selected locale and choose to write to the proper attribute depending on that.

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  def title
    self[column('title')]
  end
  def title=(str)
    self[column('title')] = str
  end
private
  def column(name)
    column_name = "#{name}_#{I18n.locale.split('-').first}"
    self.class.column_names.include?(column_name) ? column_name.to_sym : "#{name}_#{I18n.default_locale.split('-').first.to_sym}"
  end
end
```

Now, you can treat Post as if it had a normal title attribute, but it would save to the proper
column. If you don't have a column named for this attribute, it'll save or get the value of the
default_locale.

So for instance you can do this in your edit view:

``` erb
<% form_for(@post) do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
<% end %>
```

But when you have multiple columns that needs to be translated, even scattered through multiple
models, it tends to be a boring and repeating business to add all those virtual attributes. So let's
do some meta-programming, and clean up models!

First, make a file in the `RAILS_ROOT/lib` directory, called `load_translations.rb` and put in this
Ruby meta-programming goodness/madness:

``` ruby
module TranslatableColumns

  def translatable_columns(*columns)
    columns.each do |column|

      define_method column do
        self[self.class.column_translated(column)]
      end

      define_method "#{column}=" do |value|
        self[self.class.column_translated(column)] = value
      end

    end
  end

  def column_translated(name)
    column_name = "#{name}_#{I18n.locale.split('-').first}"
    self.column_names.include?(column_name) ? column_name.to_sym : "#{name}_#{I18n.default_locale.split('-').first.to_sym}"
  end

end
```

Now all you have to to in the model is extend it with this module and specify which columns can be
translated:

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend TranslatableColumns
  translatable_columns :title, :text
end
```

Still I'm not really fond of this. I can't find a good, sensible scenario where this would be the
best option. I would rather go with an attribute called 'locale'. So let's look at that too.

``` bash
./script/generate migration add_locale_to_post locale:string
rake db:migrate
```

And add a named_scope to the models you want to be localized, like Post in this case, to get the
proper locales and save it to whatever locale was selected at the moment, if it hasn't already been
set any other way (you might want to make the user able to choose it when entering the post).

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  named_scope :localized, { :conditions => { :locale => I18n.locale } } }
  before_save :store_locale
private
  def store_locale
    self[:locale] ||= I18n.locale
  end
end
```

Let's meta-program this one as well!

Get the proper posts, just call `Post.localized` or `Post.localized.find(params[:id])`. Note that
I'm not using any translatable columns now. Just use normal columns and create multiple posts if you
want more than one language for a post (e.g. create a Dutch one and a French one).

As you can see, I'm not using the translating functionality of I18n here. I just use I18n to know
which locale to choose.
